                                                      One of the biggest problems is identifying the plants that need avoiding; sometimes they’re hard to identify and more often people have no idea what the plants look like making it hard to avoid the likes of poison ivy.

                                                  <p class="card-text">It is sometimes easy to confuse edible plants with look-alikes that are toxic and dangerous.
                                                          For example, parsnip which is edible is very similar to poison hemlock which is highly toxic.

These conventions direct trail traffic, promote cleanliness, and protect domestic tranquility. They aren’t commandments, but if you don’t follow them, a more experienced hiker might notice the infraction and give you an educational scolding. To make sure you remain on the good path, here are five of the unwritten rules of hiking.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">When hiking in the great outdoors, it is crucial to remember whose home you are stepping into: bears, rattlesnakes, mountain lions, and an abundance of other wildlife. Encountering wildlife while hiking is almost a certainty, whether it is a flock of birds flying overhead or squirrels rustling in the trees. However, there are larger and deadlier predators that you must be both aware and cautious of while hiking. While animal attacks are highly uncommon, they are still possible and sometimes happen.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Usually being loud isn’t commended, however when it comes to hiking it is a must. Talk loudly, clap your hands, stomp your feet, make some noise to let wildlife know you are nearby.</p>
